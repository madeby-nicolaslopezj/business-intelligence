Activity 6

1. Train a decision tree using the training set and give the percentage of
correct classifications (Accuracy) by evaluating the model with the test set.
Give the resulting tree.

    1   2   3
1 137  15  45
2  25  34  33
3  46  26  81

2. Based on the confusion matrix of the previous question, what kind of
contraceptive method is more difficult for the tree to predict? Justify your
answer.

Total model: 57%
Method 1: 69%
Method 2: 27%
Method 3: 30%

The method 2, because it has 27% of probability.

3. Write in words the classification rules that are deduced from the tree for
the type of contraceptive method = 3.

Child ever born: >= 1
  => Wife's age: < 37,5 -> Type: 3
  => Wifes education: Case 1,2,3
    => child ever born: >= 3 -> Type: 3
  => Wifes education: Case 4
    => child ever born: case 2 or less
       => husband ocupation: not 1 -> Type: 3
    => child ever born: 3 or more
       => Wife's age < 33,5 -> Type: 3

4. Train a naive Bayes classifier using the training set and give the percentage
of correct classifications by evaluating the model with the test set. Based on
the confusion matrix, what kind of contraceptive method is more difficult for
the naive Bayes classifier to predict? Justify your answer.

    1   2   3
1 104  44  49
2  18  47  27
3  35  44  74

Total model: 50%
Method 1: 52%
Method 2: 19%
Method 3: 23%

The method 2, because it has 19% of probability.

5. Train a naive Bayes classifier using the training set but only using the
attributes that appear in the tree obtained in Question 1. Give the percentage
of correct classification when evaluating the model with the test set. Does the
performance improve when compared with what was obtained in question 4?

Attributes: children.ever.born, wife.age, wife.education, wife.work, husband.occupation

    1   2   3
1 115  26  56
2  14  39  39
3  34  30  89

Total model: 54%
Method 1: 58%
Method 2: 15%
Method 3: 22%

In general yes, but by method it only improves with the method 1.
